Hovering over this shows a tool tip containing the topic's title and filename.  If "(Not found)" is displayed
for the title, the topic's ID could not be found in a content layout file within the project.  This element
does not offer navigation as it represents the current file.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="code">image</span> element's <span class="code">xlink:href</span> attribute

is displayed for the alternate text, the image could not be found within the project with a
<span class="code">BuildAction</span> of <span class="code">Image</span>.  If "(Not set)" is shown for the
alternate text, the image was found but no alternate text has been set in the file's properties.  Select the Go

value - Hovering over this shows a tool tip containing the topic's title and filename.  If "(Not found)" is
displayed for the title, the topic's ID could not be found in a content layout file within the project.
Select the Go To Definition context menu option or Ctrl+click on the link to open the associated topic file.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="code">codeEntityReference</span> element's inner text - This represents a code
API member ID.  Selecting the Go To Definition context menu option or Ctrl+clicking the link will attempt to open
the associated code file and jump to the indicated member.  Note that navigation is only available for members
of C# projects within the current solution.  It is not possible to navigate to members in non-C# projects or to
members of base framework or reference assemblies.</p><p>Since code entity references must be fully qualified, there is an excellent probability that
the target ID's member will be found and displayed provided it is with the current solution as noted above.
However, since the ID must be parsed and searched for as text, there is a chance that an incorrect match will be
made or no match will be found.  As such, check to be sure that you ended up where you expected before making any
changes.  In the event it cannot find a match, check the ID to ensure that it is correct.  The
<span class="ui">Entity References</span> tool window can be used to verify the ID.  If the ID is correct and is within the
current solution, you may have found a case that could not be matched with enough accuracy.</p><p>Note that namespace identifiers (those IDs prefixed with "N:" or "G:") can never be matched to
a namespace declaration as namespaces do not exist as code elements identifiable in a search since they may
appear in multiple locations.  As such, these IDs are translated to the related <span class="code">NamespaceDoc</span>
or <span class="code">NamespaceGroupDoc</span> type ID and a search is performed for it instead within the
identified namespace.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="code">codeReference</span> element's inner text - This represents a code snippet
ID in a code snippets file.  The code snippet ID must appear in a file within a project in the solution and the
file's <span class="code">BuildAction</span> must be set to <span class="code">CodeSnippets</span>.  Selecting the
Go To Definition context menu option or Ctrl+clicking the link will attempt to open the associated code snippets
file and jump to the indicated ID.  If the ID contains multiple snippet identifiers after the group identifier,
only the first snippet identifier will be used for the search.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="code">token</span> element's inner text - This represents a token name in a
token file.  The token ID must appear in a file within a project in the solution and the file's
<span class="code">BuildAction</span> must be set to <span class="code">Tokens</span>.  Selecting the Go To
Definition context menu option or Ctrl+clicking the link will attempt to open the associated token file and, if

If the
target ID appears to be navigable, an underline will appear when the Ctrl key is held down and the tool tip will
indicate that you can Ctrl+click on it.  Selecting the Go To Definition context menu option or Ctrl+clicking the
link will attempt to navigate to the target element.</p><ul><li><p>The <span class="code">cref</span> attribute value on any XML comments element that supports
it - This represents a code API member ID.  Selecting the Go To Definition context menu option or Ctrl+clicking
the link will attempt to open the associated code file and jump to the indicated member.  Note that navigation is
only available for members of C# projects within the current solution.  It is not possible to navigate to members
in non-C# projects or to members of base framework or reference assemblies in Visual Studio 2013 or earlier.
Visual Studio 2015 does support Go To Definition for reference targets in XML comments and Go To Definition will
work for any valid target except those prefixed with an identifier type (E:, F:, M:, P:, or T:).</p><p>The member ID will be parsed and a best attempt will be made to match it to the correct code
member.  However, since XML comments member IDs are rarely fully qualified, a number of assumptions have to be
made and a set of search text candidates formulated as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Namespace identifiers (those IDs prefixed with "N:" or "G:") can never be matched to
namespace declarations as namespaces do not exist as code elements identifiable in a search since they may
appear in multiple locations.  As such, these IDs are translated to the related <span class="code">NamespaceDoc</span>
or <span class="code">NamespaceGroupDoc</span> type ID and a search is performed for it instead within the
identified namespace.</p></li><li><p>In the absence of any qualifying namespace or class identifiers and no parameters,
preference will be given to matching class names first followed by class members.</p></li><li><p>If any parameter information is specified, only class members will be searched for matches
(fields, properties, events, and methods in no particular order).</p></li><li><p>When searching for a class match, if the ID contains a namespace qualifier that matches
the namespace containing the class being edited or an imported namespace identified in the file, only that
namespace will be searched.</p></li><li><p>If no qualifier is present or it does not appear to match the containing namespace of the
class being edited or an imported namespace, the containing namespace, its parent namespaces, and any imported
namespaces will be searched.</p></li><li><p>In all cases, imported namespaces that look like core framework or Microsoft namespaces
will be ignored unless the containing namespace starts with one of the ignored namespace identifiers.</p></li><li><p>When searching for class and member IDs with generic type parameters, an attempt is made to
find the best match based on those type parameters.  Failing that, a best match based on the name alone is
attempted.</p></li><li><p>Likewise, for member ID searches, if parameters are specified, an attempt is made to find
the best match based on the specified parameter types.  Failing that, a best match based on the name alone is
attempted.</p></li><li><p>As a last resort, if none of the formulated qualified names produce a match, an attempt is
made to match the ID as given in the XML comments.</p></li><li><p>For specialized members such as constructors, finalizers, operator overloads, and
explicitly implemented interface members, the search adjusts the member ID as needed to obtain the best possible
match.</p></li></ul><p>With the above rules, there is a good probability that it will successfully navigate to the
correct API member.  However, check to be sure that you ended up where you expected before making any changes.
Due to the nature of trying to match unqualified member ID's there is always a degree of uncertainty in the final
result.  If the ID cannot be found, building your project can help you determine if the ID is valid or not.
Unless you have disabled the warnings, the compiler will validate all <span class="code">cref</span> member ID
values and issues a warning if they are incorrect.  If the ID is correct and is within the current solution, you
may have found a case that could not be matched with enough accuracy.</p></li><li><p>The <span class="code">conceptualLink</span> element's <span class="code">target</span> attribute
value - Hovering over this shows a tool tip containing the topic's title and filename.  If "(Not found)" is

project in the solution.  Select the Go To Definition context menu option or Ctrl+click on the link to open the
