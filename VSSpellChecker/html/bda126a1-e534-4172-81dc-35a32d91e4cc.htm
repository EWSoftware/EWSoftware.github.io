file's current content from the text editor rather than using the content on disk.  This allows it to spell check
the active content including any unsaved edits.  However, custom file editors such as form designers, XAML
designers, resource file editors, etc. may not provide a means of obtaining the current text content for the
file.  In such cases the file's content will be read from disk and spell checked.  Any spelling issues in unsaved
content will not be detected until the file is saved and the spell checking process is ran again.</p><p>As mentioned, when an issue is corrected, the tool window will open the file in a text editor
window.  If a custom editor is open for the affected file and it does not support opening a related text editor
view, you will be prompted to close the custom editor first.  If you choose not to do so, the correction
operation is canceled.  Some editors such as the resource file editor do support opening a related text editor
view of the file.  In such cases, making changes to the text editor will update the related custom editor.</p><p>In cases where the content on disk contains issues but differs from the unsaved content, you may be
told that the issue cannot be corrected because the text has been changed at the issue's location.  Save any
pending changes to open files and rerun the spell checking process to obtain accurate results based on the up to
date content.</p></div><h2 id="AdditionalEdits" class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>Editing Spell Checked Files</h2><div id="IDCABSection"><p>When an issue in the solution/project spell checking tool window is corrected, it will
automatically adjust the location of any other issues in the same file based on the change made.  If you make any
other changes to the file's content or use the active document tool window or smart tags to fix issues, the
solution/project spell checking tool window will be unaware of those changes.  If you subsequently attempt to
correct an issue in which the text at the issue's location no longer matches the word, you will be notified that
the change cannot be made.  The file will be opened and the cursor positioned at the issue's prior location.  If
you can find the issue relative to the old location, you can correct it manually.  To get the solution/project
spell checking tool window back in synch, rerun the spell checking process.</p></div><h2 id="IssueDifferences" class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>Differences in Issues Reported</h2><div id="IDDABSection"><p>The solution/project spell checker uses a different method of classifying text to find items that
it needs to spell check.  The spell check as you type and active document spell checking tool windows rely on
the classification spans provided by the text editor.  The solution/project spell checking tool window relies on
its own internal text parsers to classify text based on the file type.  As such, this may result in differences
between what is reported by it and the spell check as you type and active document spell checking tool window.</p><p>A common difference is doubled word detection.  The interactive spell checkers cannot detect
doubled words across line breaks as typically, the spans provided by the editor are limited to a single line of
text.  However, the solution/project spell checker can detect doubled words across line breaks.  As such, you may
see a reported doubled word issue in which there doesn't appear to be a doubled word in the text column.  In such
cases, the doubled word is typically at the start of the line and the first word is at the end of the prior line
which is not shown.  You can use the <strong>Go To Issue</strong> option to verify that this is the case and handle the
issue accordingly.</p><p>The solution/project text parser may report issues incorrectly under certain conditions.  For
example, it relies on a series of regular expressions to find text that appears to be comments and literal
strings.  If the text in a source code file is formatted in such a way that a mismatch occurs and it is
classified as something that it is not, you may see incorrect issues reported.  An example may be a comment
delimiter sequence that appears withing a literal string.  See the closed and open issues lists to see if the
problem has been reported as noted above.  It may be possible to adjust the classifiers to handle some cases.</p></div><h2 id="NonWords" class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>Reducing Misspelling Reports for Non-Words</h2><div id="IDEABSection"><p>In many cases, a large number of non-words will be reported as misspellings.  Examples include
format strings in designer files, CSS class names, control names, etc.  You can sometimes reduce the number of
misspellings for such non-words by defining exclusion expressions in the spell checker configuration file.  See
the <a href="6216eedb-6434-4cad-be06-576814e0b735.htm">Exclusion Expressions</a> topic for more information and some examples.</p></div><h2 id="SplitWords" class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>Words Split Across String Literals</h2><div id="IDFABSection"><p>A common occurrence in designer code, especially in Windows Forms projects, is words that get split
across string literals (i.e. "A string of text that gets separ" + "ated by the designer").  When spell checking
the solution or a project, such occurrences are joined to form a proper word before spell checking to reduce the
number of false reports caused by the separate parts.  If a split word is genuinely misspelled, it will get
reported.  However, the tool window will not allow the word to be fixed from within the tool window.  Instead,
navigate to the issue and fix it manually.  This is done on purpose to prevent the tool window from altering the
layout of the string in the designer file.</p></div><h2 id="IncorrectPlainText" class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>File Content Incorrectly Treated as Plain Text</h2><div id="IDGABSection"><p>As mentioned, the solution/project spell checking tool window uses its own set of classifiers to
parse each file's content accordingly based on the determined file type.  An attempt has been made to provide
support for as many common file types as possible.  However, the Visual Studio ecosystem is quite large and there
are many languages and/or file types that may not be handled at the present time.  As a fallback, the parser will
attempt to treat any unrecognized file types first as XML if they appear to contain XML or, failing that, as
plain text.</p><p>If you see a file in which a large number of issues are reported that appear to be code or other
such elements, it is quite possible the file or at least part of its content is being treated as plain text
because it was not recognized.  See the closed and open issues lists to see if the problem for the given file
type has been reported as noted above.  You can also use the information found in the
<a href="0ff35371-69b5-48dd-a062-037abe2469de.htm">Defining Solution/Project Spell Check Classifiers</a> topic to define a new classifier for any unknown file
types.  If you do so, feel free to submit these new classifications by opening a new issue so that they can be
included in a future release.</p></div><h2 id="HtmlContent" class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>HTML File Content Issues</h2><div id="IDHABSection"><p>The current HTML classifier should handle most HTML content without issue.  In addition, it
attempts to parse server-side script elements (i.e. PHP code, ASP.NET and Razor script blocks, etc.) as well as
client-side inline script elements using the appropriate language classifier.  If you find that it is not
reporting issues in some content or is not handling certain sections of a file appropriately, please open an
issue and provide as much detail as possible along with example content.  An attempt will be made to handle
issues as they occur and include fixes in subsequent releases.  Please bear in mind that web development is not
my area of expertise so help may be required in resolving some issues.</p></div><h2 class="quickLinkHeader"><span class="icon toggleSection" tabindex="0"><i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></span>See Also</h2><div id="seeAlsoSection"><h4>Other Resources</h4><div><a href="fa790577-88c0-4141-b8f4-d8b70f625cfd.htm">Solution/Project Spell Check Tool Window</a></div><div><a href="9581715a-a5bc-4de5-9474-eaefa38cf211.htm">Spell Checking Options</a></div><div><a href="ddf22015-1680-4421-aaa7-dda867660522.htm">Correcting Issues</a></div><div><a href="0ff35371-69b5-48dd-a062-037abe2469de.htm">Defining Solution/Project Spell Check Classifiers</a></div></div></div><div id="InThisArticleColumn" class="column is-hidden-mobile"><nav class="menu sticky is-hidden"><p class="menu-label"><strong>In This Article</strong></p><ul id="InThisArticleMenu" class="menu-list"><li><a class="quickLink">Files Open in Editors</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">Editing Spell Checked Files</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">Differences in Issues Reported</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">Reducing Misspelling Reports for Non-Words</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">Words Split Across String Literals</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">File Content Incorrectly Treated as Plain Text</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">HTML File Content Issues</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">See Also</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><footer id="PageFooter" class="footer border-top py-3 fixedFooter"><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p><a href="https://GitHub.com/EWSoftware/VSSpellChecker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copyright © 2013-2023, Eric Woodruff, All rights reserved</a></p><div class="feedbackLink">Send comments on this topic to
