They appear on the design surface as they do at
runtime.  Their properties can be edited using the normal <strong>Properties</strong> window.  To define image areas, a
custom collection editor is provided that lets you add, edit, and delete image areas as well as visually select
the area's coordinate locations.</p><ul class="is-hidden-tablet"><li><a href="#the-areas-collection-editor">The Areas Collection Editor</a></li><li><a href="#image-area-coordinate-considerations">Image Area Coordinate Considerations</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="the-areas-collection-editor" class="quickLinkHeader">The Areas Collection Editor</h2><div id="IDBABSection"><p>The designer is common to both controls.  The only difference is in the properties available to the
image areas themselves.  To access the area designer, go to the <span class="code">Areas</span> properties for the
image map control and click the "<strong>...</strong>" button as indicated in the example below.</p><figure class="mediaCenter"><img alt="Collection editor" src="../media/CollectionEditor.png" /></figure><p>The image area collection editor is based on the standard Visual Studio collection editor.  Members
of the collection are shown in the list box on the left and properties for the selected object are shown on the
right.  The member descriptions are composed of the area's tool tip, shape type, and coordinates.  Note that the
order of the areas in the collection does not affect their tab order within the image map.  The
<span class="code">TabIndex</span> property controls that.</p><figure class="mediaCenter"><img alt="Area editor" src="../media/AreaEditor.png" /></figure><p>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to add a rectangle image area. Click the down arrow button next to it
(shown expanded in the example above) to choose the type of image area to add.  Rectangle, Circle, and Polygon
are available to both the web control and the Windows Forms control.  Ellipse is only available to the Windows
Forms control.  Click the <strong>Remove</strong> button to delete an image area from the collection.</p><p>All image areas have a common set of properties with the exception of those that represent the
underlying coordinates of the actual shape. The rectangle image area has a <span class="code">Rectangle</span>
property that lets you specify the top left corner and its width and height. The ellipse image area has an
<span class="code">Ellipse</span> property that lets you specify the top left corner and its width and height.
The circle image area has <span class="code">CenterPoint</span> and <span class="code">Radius</span> properties
that let you define its center point and radius.  The polygon image area has a <span class="code">Points</span>
collection that lets you define the points in the polygon. The polygon's <span class="code">Points</span> property
uses another standard collection editor dialog to let you enter multiple points by hand.</p><p>Coordinates can also be entered by hand into the <span class="code">Coordinates</span> property of
each area type.  The rectangle and ellipse coordinates specify the top left and bottom right points.  The circle
coordinates specify the center point and radius.  The polygon coordinates specify pairs of X,Y coordinates that
make up the polygon vertices.</p><figure class="mediaCenter"><img alt="Coordinate editor" src="../media/CoordinateEditor.png" /></figure><p>The easiest way by far to specify coordinates for any area is to use the visual coordinate
selection tool.  This is accessed by selecting the <span class="code">Coordinates</span> property on any image
area and clicking the "<strong>...</strong>" button as indicated in the example above.  When clicked,
the following dialog box appears that lets you specify the coordinates interactively by drawing on the image
itself with the mouse.</p><figure class="mediaCenter"><img alt="Image editor" src="../media/ImageEditor.png" /></figure><p>For the web server control, you may first have to navigate into the folder that contains the image
file so that the designer can load it.  This only happens on first use.  After that, the designer remembers the
folder and will look there for the image first.</p><p>The image file name (web server control only), the image height, and the image width are displayed
above the image in the top left corner of the dialog.  The current X,Y coordinates of the mouse cursor are shown
in the upper right corner.  Instructions on how to select the image area are shown in the lower left corner.</p><p>When first opened, any existing coordinates will be used to draw the existing area on the image.
For rectangles and ellipses, click and hold the left mouse button near an existing corner outside of the
rectangle and you can drag the corner to a new position.  For circles, clicking anywhere and dragging will expand
the circle to the new size.  For polygons, clicking points will extend the polygon by adding new vertices.  The
designer will not let you extend a shape outside the bounds of the image itself.</p><p>When creating a new polygon, you must click at least two points before the first line will appear.
A minimum of three points must be clicked to form a basic polygon.  Note that when drawn in the designer, the
polygon will not be closed (the final point will not connect back to the first point).  This will happen
automatically at runtime.  As such, you do not have to manually connect the polygon's end point to its starting
point.</p><p>The button groups down the right side of the dialog allow you to make adjustments to the area's
position and size.  The top set of buttons allows you to move the entire image area in any direction.  The middle
set of buttons allows you to increase the size of any side of the area.  The center button in the set will expand
all sides of the area.  The bottom set of buttons allows you to decrease the size of any side of the area.  The
center button in the set will shrink all sides of the area.  The shrink and expand buttons are hidden for polygon
areas as it is not possible to accurately shrink or expand the vertices of a polygon.  Single click the buttons
to make minor adjustments.  Click and hold the buttons to repeatedly make the selected adjustment and release it
to stop.</p><p>The <strong>Show All</strong> checkbox allows you to toggle the display of all other image areas on and
off.  This is most useful in owner drawn image maps that don't have an image defined.  By showing all other image
areas, it gives you reference points by which you can add or adjust the area being edited.</p><p>To clear any current area coordinates and start again, click the <strong>Clear</strong> button.  To accept
your changes to the coordinates, click the <strong>OK</strong> button.  To discard your changes, click the <strong>Cancel</strong>
button.</p></div><h2 id="image-area-coordinate-considerations" class="quickLinkHeader">Image Area Coordinate Considerations</h2><div id="IDCABSection"><p>Image area coordinates are dependent upon the height and width of the image in effect at the time
they are defined.  If you subsequently change the image to a different file or change the image's width or height
properties, you will most likely invalidate the coordinates for the image areas.  At the very least, they
probably will not surround the original area of the image.  The image area collection will remain intact, but you
will have to revisit each area and adjust its coordinates to work with the new image and its dimensions.</p><p>Note that changing the width or height of the Windows Forms image map control will not affect the
image areas.  The displayed image's width and height are independent of the Windows Forms control's width and
height.  The web server control's height and width are directly tied to the image's width and height and changes
to them will affect the image area coordinates.</p></div><h2 id="see-also" class="quickLinkHeader">See Also</h2><div id="IDDABSection"><p><strong>Other Resources</strong><br /><a href="7e07e290-7738-4d8b-bcf1-8eb4b33706b0.htm">Welcome</a></p></div></div><div id="InThisArticleColumn" class="column is-hidden-mobile"><nav class="menu sticky is-hidden"><p class="menu-label"><strong>In This Article</strong></p><ul id="InThisArticleMenu" class="menu-list"><li><a class="quickLink">The Areas Collection Editor</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">Image Area Coordinate Considerations</a></li><li><a class="quickLink">See Also</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div><footer id="PageFooter" class="footer border-top py-3 fixedFooter"><div class="columns"><div id="FooterContent" class="column"><p><a href="https://github.com/EWSoftware/ImageMaps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[v2022.1.3.0] Copyright © 2004-2023, Eric Woodruff, All Rights Reserved</a></p><div class="feedbackLink">Send comments on this topic to
